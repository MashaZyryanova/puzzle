For my final project I wanted to explore how to work with Canvas from chapter 16 
of the text book.
While studying how to do it, I practiced using project oriented programming 
creating classes and using them to create Canvas animation
although my project is only two pages I spent over 50 hours on it experimenting and learning
technologies 
I started by just creating one piece on canvas, than proceded tp figure out how to make those pbjects 
programmatically ( as many as I want)

For the second page I also used canvas to create a puzzle. I created a button that would allow to choose
levels of difficulty for the puzzle from 4 options.

There is a lot more that could be improved but for now I am happy with the resluts.
